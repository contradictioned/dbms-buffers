  # The clock buffer, also known as second-change buffer,

  # When the buffer is full and a not-yet-inserted entry needs space,
  # the hand goes clockwise until it finds an entry with clock_value = 0.
  # This entry is evicted, removed from the buffer, and the new values
  # is inserted with clock_value 1.
  # All entries the hand passes where clock_value = 1, this value is decremented,
  # but they are not replaced yet (they have a second chance).
  # When an element is accessed that has clock_value = 0, this value is set to 1 again.
